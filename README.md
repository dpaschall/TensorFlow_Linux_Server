# TensorFlow_Linux_Server
# A repo specifically containing all the code to build TensorFlow from source or with a docker.
# will have GPU support.

Documentation folder contains the links to get setup and the requirements.

test_TensorFlow_Linux folder has some good example files to run to confirm tensorFlow works

bin folder will contain the actual setup files needed for the linux pc to run tensorFlow optimally
the setup_all.py script will do the setup/build process automatically, and test using the Mandelbrot set.

TO-DO:
Danny > Start a fresh linux machine and get tensorFlow installed using a dock or building from source.
Critter > Add CUDA and GPU support
Daniel > Get TensorBoard working and both the Mandelbrot & Cifar10 examples working
